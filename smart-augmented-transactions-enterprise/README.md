## What is Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise?

Smart Augmented Transactions provides you with real-time feedback on business operations, rapid innovation on insight-driven workloads, and the ability to unlock live operational intelligence across the business. The in-memory computing platform delivers the necessary components of a cloud-native translytical architecture that combines transactions and analytics workloads in a single platform to empower real-time analytics immediately over transactional data.

Benefits & Features: 
* Enrich Real-Time Analytics with Historical Context - Smart Augmented Transactions powers event-triggered real-time analytics on streaming data enriched with historical context to help your insight-driven organization address time-sensitive decisions â€“ enhancing business operations, regulatory compliance and customer experience.
* Out-of-the-Box Machine and Deep Learning - Contains the frameworks for scalable data-driven solutions including SQL, Spark, streaming, ML and deep learning. Your applications leverage faster and smarter insights from ML models running on any data source whether structured, unstructured or semi-structured.
* Enhanced Pushdown Predicates - Smart Augmented Transactions enhances the Agile Spark pushdown predicate capability by leveraging our native advanced indexing mechanism, to retrieve only relevant data entries when running a query (filter). This ability to filter directly on the source (instead of on the target as is done in the vanilla Apache Spark architecture) dramatically improves performance and reduces network overhead.
* Fastest In-Memory Performance - Other in-memory solutions aggregate data on the client-side, but with InsightEdge Smart Augmented Transactions, analytics are distributed on the server-side in the same memory space as the data to accelerate performance and reduce networking and serialization overhead. The platform delivers high throughput transaction and stream processing supporting millions of IOPS.
* Always-On Services - Enterprise-grade and highly available with disk/database persistence, disaster recovery, self-healing functionality as well as upgrades and scaling without downtime. Geo-redundancy and fast data replication for disaster recovery. Data security and consistency is ensured between data centers and data stores including hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.
* AIOps for Autonomous Elasticity and Scale - Automatic triggers to elastically scale either up or out for transactional and analytical workloads, based on the CPU and RAM utilization. The scaling process is done in a rolling manner without downtime while the cache remains fully operational. Data is automatically stored in multiple tiers, RAM, SSD or database, according to the defined business policy to optimize business results and TCO.

# Getting Started

To test the Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image, run the following in your command line to display a help screen with all the available commands: 

```
docker run gigaspaces/smart-augmented-transactions-enterprise --help
```

 For example, the `version` command prints version information:

```
docker run gigaspaces/smart-augmented-transactions-enterprise version
```

# How to Use this Image

The Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image utilizes GigaSpaces' command line interface (CLI). To learn more about the command line interface, see [CLI documentation](https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/admin/tools-cli.html "CLI documentation"), or use the `--help` option.

The Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise image requires a license key to run, which can be provided using the `GS_LICENSE` environment variable. You can use the `tryme` license, which enables you to use the full Smart Augmented Transactions product for 24 hours (and then terminates the image), or you can  get a longer [evaluation license](http://gigaspaces.com/eval-license).


# Running Your First Container

The simplest and fastest way to start working with Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise is to get a single instance up and running on your local machine.  After the instance is initiated, you can start to explore the various features and capabilities.

To run a single host on your machine:

```
docker run --name test -it -e GS_LICENSE=tryme gigaspaces/smart-augmented-transactions-enterprise
```

When running the Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image without arguments, a host is automatically started with the following components:

* Platform Manager (mapped to port `8090`) [Learn more](https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/admin/xap-manager.html)
* Web Management Console (mapped to port `8099`) [Learn more](https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/admin/tools-web-ui.html)
* Spark master (mapped to port `8080`)
* Spark worker (mapped to port `8081`)
* Apache Zeppelin (mapped to port `9090`)

*Note: These ports are mapped to your host, so you can access them.*


# Connecting to the Client

Docker runs containers in a bridge network by default. You can use any of the options described below to enable a client to connect to the Space.

### Running the Client with the Docker Bridge Network

By default, the client uses the host network interface. You can configure the client to use the Docker bridge network interface (the IP address is usually 172.17.0.x). Use the `GS_NIC_ADDRESS` environment variable to enable the client to contact and interact with the Space.

**NOTE: This only works for clients that reside on the same host as the Space. The Docker bridge network is inaccessible to other hosts.**

### Running the Client in Another Docker Container

Docker containers that reside on the same host use the same bridge network. If the client is in a Processing Unit, you can run it via another Docker container with the `pu run` command.

**NOTE: This only works for clients that reside on the same host as the Space. Docker containers on other hosts will use a different bridge network.**

### Using the Host Network

Docker can run containers on the host network using the `--net=host` option with the `docker run` command. In this case, the client can connect and interact with the Space without additional configuration.

**NOTE: Docker only supports the `--net=host` option on Linux hosts.**

### Configuring the Public Host

By default, the data grid's core communication protocol (LRMI) uses the same network interface for both binding and publishing. You can modify this, using the `GS_PUBLIC_HOST` enviromnent variable, to instruct Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise to publish itself using a different network address, for example the host's network address. In this case, you'll have to expose the ports listed in the [Ports](#ports) section from the Docker container to the host. For example:

```
docker run --name test -it -e GS_LICENSE=tryme -e GS_PUBLIC_HOST=<your-host-ip-or-name> -p 4174:4174 -p 8200-8300:8200-8300 gigaspaces/smart-augmented-transactions-enterprise
```
# Running a Production Cluster on Multiple Hosts

When running Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise in Docker containers on multiple hosts, you need to either configure `GS_PUBLIC_HOST` or use the `--net=host` option as described above, so that containers on different hosts can interact with each other.

The `GS_PUBLIC_HOST` environment variable complies with common practices of Docker usage, and maintains image isolation. However, as per the Docker documentation, to get optimal performance it is recommended to use the `--net=host` option, which uses the host network and removes the extra network hop. The Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image supports both options, so choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Beyond the Basics

# Configuring the `GS_MANAGER_SERVER` IP Address

When running Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise on multiple hosts, you can configure the IP address for the Platform Manager in your network in the `GS_MANAGER_SERVERS` environment variable. `GS_MANAGER_SERVERS=host1,host2,host3` by default is the local manager.

# Ports

The Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image uses the ports described in the table below. You can change each port using the respective environment variable, or map it to a different port using the `-p` option in `docker run`. For example, `-p 5174:4174` maps the lookup discovery port to a different port, but maintains the same port within the container.

| Environment Variable                      | Default Value | Description |

# Running Other CLI Commands

The Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image utilizes GigaSpaces' command line interface (CLI). Any arguments following the image name are passed to the command line.

If no arguments are specified after the image, the default `host run-agent --auto` command will be run.

To learn more about the command line interface, refer to the [CLI documentation](https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/admin/tools-cli.html "CLI documentation"), or use the `--help` option.


# Using a Different Java Version

This Smart Augmented Transactions Enterprise Docker image is based on the official [openjdk](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/) image, and uses Java version 8. To use a different Java version, you have to build a new image using the `JAVA_TAG` build argument. For example:
```
docker build --build-arg JAVA_TAG=9 -t gigaspaces/smart-augmented-transactions-enterprise:openjdk-9 .
```
If you're not sure which versions are available, refer to the [supported tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/openjdk/tags/) page.

You can also build from a different base image, or even create your own, using the `JAVA_IMAGE` build argument (e.g. `--build-arg JAVA_IMAGE=...`)

#  Accessing the Logs

All logs are stored in `opt/gigaspaces/logs` within the container. To access the logs, you can do one of the following:

- Use the `-v` option in your `docker run` command to map this to a folder on your host.
- Use the `docker cp` command to copy the files from a Docker instance to a location on your host.

To mount the directory to get the logs, use the following command:
```
 -v c:/gigaspaces/test/logs:/opt/gigaspaces/logs
```
To copy logs from a running instance, use the following command:
```
docker cp containerId:/opt/gigaspaces/logs .
```
