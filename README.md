##  GigaSpaces Docker Images.

The InsightEdge platform, a combination of the XAP in-memory data grid and an open-source analytics ecosystem, is an in-memory insight platform that supports fast-data analytics, artificial intelligence and real-time applications. Customers can use this platform to develop their own systems that provide instant data-driven insights with time-to-analytics at a sub-second scale. InsightEdge also enables hyperscaling analytics from SQL, and streaming to machine learning via Apache Spark.

The InsightEdge platform provides extreme performance with ultra-low latency, high-throughput transactions and stream processing, due to the co-location of applications and analytics. All of this functionality is available in a cloud-native, infrastructure-agnostic deployment for hybrid cloud and on-premises environments.

GigaSpaces provides Docker images for the following products:

- XAP open source edition, which  provides an in-memory data grid with rich performance capabilities and extreme low latency. 

- XAP Enterprise edition, which includes feature-rich management, monitoring, and high availability capabilities, security features, language interoperability, and multi-tiered data storage across RAM/SSD/Storage-Class Memory (3DXPoint).

- InsightEdge open source edition, which uses IEP Open Source to supercharge your Spark workloads.

- InsightEdge Enterprise edition, which offers all the above plus high availability (up to 5 nines) with auto-healing, disaster recovery via geo-redundancy, fast data replication and native persistence.
